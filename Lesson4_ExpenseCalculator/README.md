### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. In this assignment one lesson I learned was that of variables. There are variable scopes which is where a declared variable can be used, global variables which can be declared outside a function and local variables which may only declared within a function.
2. Another lesson I learned was in regards to numeric data which is what was dealt with primarily in this assignment. I learned about the differences between integers and floating point numbers. 
3. The last lesson I learned had to do with strings. In this assignment many strings were used. Strings have different operators that may be used and different characters and sequences as well.
